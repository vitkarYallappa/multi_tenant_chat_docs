You are a senior architect helping me build a complex enterprise chat platform. I need a full implementation plan based on the Chat Service architecture described in the provided documentation. Please generate a structured 4-month roadmap, divided into 10 phases and 18 clear steps. Each phase should include:
1. What will be implemented (services, components, modules)
2. Which folders and files will be created or updated
3. Documentation of each file (what it does and how it's used)
4. All methods inside each file with:
   - Method name
   - Purpose
   - Parameters (name, type, description)
   - Return type
5. Cross-service relationships, where applicable
6. Technologies or protocols used (e.g., FastAPI, Redis, Kafka, gRPC)
7. Key error handling and performance considerations
Base the implementation plan on the following Chat Service structure:
- API: Endpoints and middlewares
- Core: Channels, processors, normalizers
- Services: Business logic
- Repositories: Data access
- Events: Kafka publishing/subscription
- Models: MongoDB, Redis, Pydantic
- Clients: gRPC for MCP and Security Hub
- Utilities: Formatters, metrics, logging, validation
- Exceptions: Custom error handlers
- Config: Constants, env setup
- Tests: Unit, integration, E2E
- DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD
Ensure that each phase is well-balanced and builds upon previous ones. The roadmap must be executable by a dev team, with realistic pacing for a 4-month timeline. Use markdown for formatting.

create 10 phase seperate markdown files so in future developement is good for us in cloud code editor
