You are assisting with the development of a scalable, production-grade Chat Service using FastAPI.  
I will provide the following:

📁 Folder Structure
📜 Phase-wise Implementation Guide
Includes: reference code, file-specific requirements, and explicit file paths for this phase
🧠 Database Schema
🧩 API Specification
 -- and also uploaded phase 5 completion text.txt
---

### 🎯 Objective

Based strictly on the files and folders named in the current Phase-wise Implementation Guide, generate complete, production-ready implementations for only those files.

---

### 📏 Scope Rules

⚠️ Do not include any files that are not listed by name in the current phase.  
✅ If reference code is given for a file listed in the phase, use and extend it.  
❌ Do not assume additional files (e.g., Clean Architecture layers) unless explicitly mentioned.

---

### ✅ Requirements

🧼 Follow SOLID Principles
📋 Include:
Dependency Injection support if mentioned
Centralized error handling or logging if part of this phase
⚙️ Implement reference methods or skeletons from the guide into fully working modules
📁 Respect folder paths and filenames as listed — do not re-organize
🛑 Do not include code from future phases
---

### 📤 Output Format:

For each file:
- Use the following structure:

Each file will be self-contained and output as text/markdown with detailed comments.

I'll ensure it's clean, testable, and production-ready.

if possible create file in separate text/markdown in cloud editor
